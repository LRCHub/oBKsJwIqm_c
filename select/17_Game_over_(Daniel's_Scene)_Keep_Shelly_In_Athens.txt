Heard a woman
In my mind
'(you'll) lose your keel,' yeeeeeah
'Withered spirits
Cannot fly
Above the wind'

Tell them 'worry
Bout the words
That won't heal,' yeeeeeah
Hold the greater,
Your only, lie
More than I

I'm a moron
I'm alone in this strife, yeeeeeah
Holey creatures
We come to life
Come to life

Un-tell my heart
Under my heart
Can you wreck me?
Holding steady now
Turn me red from my heart
Game over
Time is ready now
Turn me red from my
Time is ready now
Turn me into stone
