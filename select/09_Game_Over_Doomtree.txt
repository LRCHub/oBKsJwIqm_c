Welcome to the future! / Rap won't save you! / Can you hear that? / RAP WON'T SAVE YOU! / You want the truth? / You can't
Handle the truth / You want Phantom sun-roofs, Armadale 80 proof / From shake to shook to shuck / from cake to cook to cluck
No hustling backwards / that's the labor of luck / Gander back / holla front / Fuck a Mack of the Month / Where the Zag? / Roll
The blunt and chill the fuck out (chill) / But you better / chunk 'em up doggy / sweep the leg Johnny / what it do whoady? / Hit 'em
Up homey / Get 'em up off me / Walk away talking shit and acting cocky / He ain't gon' harm me / Bob Marley / better off kicking
Rocks with his army / Wet 'em up OG / simmer down Rudy / settle back mommy / saddleback booty / I'm a Dogtown b-boy / low
On the see-saw / from the shore to the sea floor / De la Doom (huh?) / from the Tree (oh!) / oak medallions (what?) / No bling.
You went the wrong way / down a one way / One way out / one way to win / Go big or go home boy/ Go all in / Ahhh yeah get
'Em riled up / Game over / Game over.
It's all this coke, it's all that liq / it's all the fame / It's all been done, it's all been fixed / it's all the same / I got no time for games,
Lames or dames. / Time.
Time for some rearrangements / Take the Independent Railroad / we gonna get 'em out the slave whips / til they're wireless and
Chainless / Are those the Faces of Death / or just stages of being famous? / It's the monotone, monosyllabic mono-stereo solid
Zone cold static / Malachi York looper / Stuck on Lucifer Big Boss Koopa/ Super Downloader Bros. down low / Until the suture
Opens / choke on hookah / turn the cheek / and make a nuclear war head / arm-legga-legga-arm-head-lock / suicide smart bomb
I say my name "Mictlan" like an "X" in Islam.
I got no time for games, lames, or dames.
It's all this coke, it's all that liq / it's all the fame / It's all been done, it's all been fixed / it's all the same / I got no time for games,

And if you're sick of the world / well I'm sick of the wording / and I could be sick of it all / but I'm just sick from the earling / If you
Don't stick to wall / you better stick 'em up early / If that ain't stickin' at all / then just stick up the birdie / like hush...
It's all this coke, it's all that liq / it's all the fame / It's all been done, it's all been fixed / it's all the same / I got no time for games,
